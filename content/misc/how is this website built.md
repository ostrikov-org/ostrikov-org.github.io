> [!question] How is this website built?
> This website is built using [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz), which generates a static, yet feature-full website from Obsidian's markdown. 
>
> Even though I like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish), for me personally, the *flexibility* and *ability to self-host* with quartz was a selling point[^1]

[^1]: Quartz is absolutely free of charge and shipped with an MIT license. The **selling point** is just **my phrasing** 😅
